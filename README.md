# Advent of Code 2024 solved with Elixir

WIP. This is my first time using Elixir, and first time doing AOC, so the solutions are not optimal nor idiomatic.

## Overview
The implementation for each puzzle resides in a .ex module in the `lib` folder.
`lib/Day01_P01.ex`
`lib/Day01_P02.ex`
`lib/Day02_P01.ex`

These map to an associated puzzle input `inputs/Day01_P01_input.txt`.

Running `mix solve {day} {puzzle}` will output the solution for the given day and puzzle.
