Don't disabled all following muls
do re-enables for all following muls

example
mul mul mul don't x x x do mul do mul don't x x do mul mul mul don't don't do mul

add an explicit "do" to the start.

split on "don't"
[
 "do mul mul mul",
 "x x x do mul do mul",
 "x x do mul mul mul",
 " ",
 "do mul"
]

split again on "do"
[
 ["", "mul mul mul"], # first can be discarded
 ["x x x", "mul", "mul"], # first can be discarded
 ["x x", "mul mul mul"], # first can be discarded
 [" "], 
 ["", "mul"]
]

discard and flatten

["mul mul mul", "mul", "mul"]
rejoin
"mul mul mulmulmul"
split and parse with previous algorithm
