# Parsing the input

When an invalid rule is found, we need to correct it

Assume there are no incompatible rules
e.g. `{ {0,1}, {1,2}, {2,0}}` would be impossible to resolve

Assume all pages have a rule, otherwise they could be placed anywhere in the list, which could mess up the solution (middle value)

Can correction of a rule make an earlier rule invalid?
Yes, example:
rules `{{0,1}, {1,2}, {9,0}}`
input `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
By fixing 0, we break 0,1.
By fixing 1, we break 1,2.

So whenever a page is moved, we must revalidate all the rules for that page
