# Day09_P01

Push puzzle inputs to a list of gaps and list of items
They will be reversed.

```elixir
# 12345 -> A..BBB....CCCCC
# reversed by prepending to list {block_id, size}
blocks_reversed = [{c, 5}, {b, 3}, {a, 1}]
# gaps after 0 and 1 {gap_id, size}
gaps_unreversed = [{a, 2}, {b, 4}]
```

From the pop items from data and assign to gaps
Data can be assigned to multiple gaps
Gaps can be split

```elixir
# gap_a (the gap after block_a) is assigned 2 units from block_c
# {gap_id, block_id, size}
[{a, c, 2}]
# 5 - 2 = 3 remaining in block. gap_a full. Assign to gap_b
[{b, c, 3}, {a, c, 2}]
# block_c is exhausted but gap_b is unfilled
# Try to assign from next block (block_b)
# END CASE: the block_b == gap_b, ids are the same, the end has been reached. Discard the remaining gaps.
blocks_remaining = [{b, 3}, {a, 1}]
# now we can zip them together
# by reversing and enumerating from block_a and inserting gap_x after block_x
# then stripping the gap_id to get the final order
zipped = [{a, 1}, {c, 2}, {b, 3}, {c, 3}]
# ACCBBBCCC
