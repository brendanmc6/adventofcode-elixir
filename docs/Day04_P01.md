Summary
We are counting all occurances of "xmas" in the input.

Directions to search:

- left to right in row
- right to left in row
- top to bottom in column
- bottom to top in column
- top to diagonal right
- top to diagonal left
- bottom to diagonal right
- bottom to diagonal left

# Ideas - starting with simplest case (left to right in string)

## String.split() idea

- start with "xmasxxxmasxxxmasxxxmas"
- split on "xmas"
- get ["", "xx", "xx", "xx", ""]
- answer is length - 1

This would require me to reconstruct the rows, columns, diagonals as strings

## Recursive search / sliding pane?

```elixir
starts_with_xmas(string, count) do
  is_xmas = String.starts_with("xmas", string)
  new_count = if is_xmas, do: count + 1, else: count
  next_index = if is_xmas, do: 5, else: 1
  starts_with_xmas(String.slice(string, next_index..-1), new_count)
end

# final base case would be length(string) < 4
```

## Better data structure?

If I want to check diagonal I would ideally use coordinates.
Column is positive x coord
Row is positive y coord (top to bottom)
Store as a map of tuples.

For scanning...
left -> right:

- start at (0, y)
  increment x

right -> left:

- start at (max_x, y)
  decrement x

top -> bottom:

- start at (x, 0)
  increment y

bottom -> top:

- start at (x, max_y)
  decrement y

top -> DR

- start at (x, 0)
  increment x and y

top -> DL

- start at (max_x, y)
  decrement x, increment y

bottom -> DR

- start at (0, max_y)
  increment x, decrement y

bottom -> DL

- start at (max_x, max_y)
  decrement x, decrement y

Map of tuples for efficient lookup

```elixir
%{
    {0, 0} => "X",
    {1, 0} => "M",
    {2, 0} => "A",
    {3, 0} => "S",
}
```

# Solution

Read the raw input to a list of strings (rows)

Reduce the list of strings to a struct

```elixir
defmodule Grid do
  defstruct map: %{}, max_x: 0, max_y: 0
end
```

- For each char at index X in the string, given row y, push {x, y} to the map
- set max_x and max_y (the last col of the last row will be the max)
- Return the map and repeat for each row Y
- pass the Grid struct as puzzle_input

Write recursive counters for each direction

```elixir
  {0, puzzle_input}
  |> countLR()
  |> countRL()
  |> countTB()
  |> countBT()
  |> countTDR()
  |> countTDL()
  |> countBDR()
  |> countBDL()
```
