Tolerate a single bad level per report

7 6 4 2 1: Safe without removing any level.
1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe regardless of which level is removed.
9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe regardless of which level is removed.
1 3 2 4 5: Safe by removing the second level, 3.
8 6 4 4 1: Safe by removing the third level, 4.
1 3 6 7 9: Safe without removing any level.

Naiv solution: omit the first error we find
    e.g. incrementing gap 1 2 3 6 10 7 8 -> remove 10 - works
    e.g. incrementing duplicate 1 2 3 6 6 7 8 -> remove 6 - works
    e.g. incrementing inversion 1 2 3 6 5 7 8 -> remove 5 - works
    e.g. decrementing gap 10 9 8 4 7 6 5 -> remove 4 -  works
    e.g. decrementing inversion 10 7 4 5 3 2 1 -> remove 5 - works
    e.g. starting duplicate 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -> remove 1 - works
    e.g. 1 4 7 10 8 9 10 -> ❌doesn't work, need to remove left
    e.g. false start - 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -> ❌doesn't work, need to remove first element (can't remove right or left!)
    e.g. false start - 1 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 -> ❌doesn't work, need to remove first element (can't remove right or left!)

Solution
if we encounter a bad number on the righthand side
 - try removing it
 else - try removing lefthand side
 else - try removing first number
