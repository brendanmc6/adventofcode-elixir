All increasing or all decreasing, by at least 1, at most 3

Shortcut math:
Smallest valid increase
n0 + (length - 1)

Largest valid increase
n0 + ((length - 1) * 3)

Smallest valid decrease
n0 - (length - 1)

Largest valid decrease
n0 - ((length - 1) * 3)

Since I have to compare elements anyways I won't take shortcuts

Solution

Parse inputs to get list of lists of numbers (lists, because report length is unknown)
Reduce list of lists into a count (+1 for each safe list)
    next item increments 1-3
    next item decrements 1-3
