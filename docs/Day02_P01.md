All increasing or all decreasing, by at least 1, at most 3

Shortcut math:
Smallest valid increase
n0 + (length - 1)

Largest valid increase
n0 + ((length - 1) * 3)

Smallest valid decrease
n0 - (length - 1)

Largest valid decrease
n0 - ((length - 1) * 3)

Solution

Parse inputs to get list of lists of numbers (because report length is unknown)
Filter to remove lines where last item violates the min/max rule above
