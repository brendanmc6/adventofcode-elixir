# Day 2 Puzzle 2 Summary
How often does each number in the left list appear in the right list?

Total similarity score
    Multiply each number in the left list, by its count in the right list
    Sum the total

Example
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

simularity cores in the example:
3 * 3 = 9
4 * 1 = 4
2 * 0 = 0
1 * 0 = 0
3 * 3 = 9
3 * 3 = 9
Total = 31

# Solution brainstorm
No need to sort anymore.

Math shortcut:
    number * leftCount * rightCount
    3 * 3 * 3 = 27
    4 * 1 * 1 = 4
    2 * 1 * 0 = 0
    1 * 1 * 0 = 0

iterate once, reduce tuples to a map of counts
and iterating a second time to increment the counters
    %{ number => {count_left, count_right} }
Then enumerate and reduce
    (number * leftCount * rightCount) + acc
