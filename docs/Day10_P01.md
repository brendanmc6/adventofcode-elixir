# Day10_P01 Notes

Sum the scores of trailheads

# Determine a trailhead score

Count of unique 9's that can be reached by a valid path:

- only up by 1
- only cardinal directions

## Pathfinding brainstorm - brute force

Given a list of trailheads and a grid of `%{ coord => heights }` and a max_x, max_y boundary
For each cardinal direction, sum the trail score
score is 0 if it is impassible or does not terminate at a 9

### Recursive trail score

Base case - 9
return `[coord]`
Base case - impassible or boundary
return `[]`
Recurse case - passable
return coords reached by all 4 cardinals
