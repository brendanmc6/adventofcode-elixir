# Day08_P01

_How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?_

# Brainstorm

Parse the input into a grid of antennae locations, or a map of antennae id to coords.

```elixir
antennae = %{
  id => {coord1, coord2, coord3}
}
```

And the map bounds, with min_x and min_y being 0

```elixir
{max_x, max_y}
```

Finding adjacent antennae. If we map by id instead we can efficiently find all antennae of the same freq. and calculate the vectors between them.

```elixir
coords = antennae[id]
```

The antinodes are stored as a `MapSet` of coords (list of unique locations)

An antinode is found by calculating the vector between two coords. For example,

With antennae A at `{4,3}` and antenna B at `{5,5}`
We can calculate a vector from A to B of `vector_a_to_b = b - a = {1, 2}`
And from B to a `vector_a_to_b = a - b = {-1, -2}`
So to find antinode_b, do `b + vector_a_to_b = {6,7}`
And antinode_a, `a + vector_b_to_a = {3,1}`

```
..........
...#......
..........
....a.....
..........
.....a....
..........
......#...
..........
..........
```

So this is done for every pair of coords.
Given a list of coords, we need to construct pairs.
`{coord_a, coord_b, coord_c, coord_d}`

```
ab, ac, ad
bc, bd,
cd
```

Write the antinodes to the set, and filter the set by the boundary.

Return the length of the set.

# implementation steps

1. `read()` the input to a list of rowstrings.
2. `parse()` the rowstrings to a map of `antennae` coords.
3. Reduce to the map of coords, to a list of antennae pairs.
4. Apply the vector logic to record antinodes
5. Filter out of bounds nodes
