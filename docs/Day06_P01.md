# Considerations

- After capturing start coordinate, need to replace "^" with "." as this is not an obstacle
- Start position must be counted as "visited"

# Data structures

`{x, y}` vectors for cardinal directions
Define a circular structure for easy rotation

```elixir
north = {0, -1}
east = {1, 0}
south = {0, 1}
west = {-1, 0}

rotations = %{
    north => east,
    east => south,
    south => west,
    west => north
}

next_vector = rotations[current_vector]

```

store puzzle input as a map of structs, with slot for `visted` state.

```elixir
grid = %{
  {0, 0} => %Cell{
    coord: {0, 0},
    can_visit: true, # "."
    visited: 0
  }
}
```

Recursive "visit_cell" function.

- takes vector
- takes current_cell
- takes next_cell
  - already fetched from map to enable pattern matching in guard
- marks `grid[current_cell.coord].visited` as 1
- base case: `next_cell == nil`
  - end
- rotate case: `next_cell.can_visit == false`
  - rotate `new_vector = rotate(vector)`
  - fetch `rotated_next_cell`
  - recurse on self `visit_cell(new_vector, current_cell, rotated_next_cell)`
- proceed case: `next_cell.can_visit == true`
  - fetch `next_next_cell`
  - recurse on next `visit_cell(vector, next_cell, next_next_cell)`

# Find solution:

```elixir
Map.values(grid) |> Enum.sum_by(& &1.visited)
```
