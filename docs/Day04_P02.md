Summary
We are counting all occurances of intersecting MAS

Vectors are:
SE
SW
NE
NW

We can no long scan vector by vector, we need to check for intersection.

We should only scan SE and NW vectors, (LTR, row by row) to avoid double counting.

### When a SE (1, 1) match is found at {x,y}, check x+2 for a SW match, and check y+2 for a NE match

- coord `{2, 2}` -> `2 + vector * (word_length-1)` -> `2 + 2` -> check `{4, 2}` & `{2, 4}`
- Check X to SW `{4, 2}` invert vector X from SE to SW -> `{-1, 1}`
- Check Y `{2, 4}` invert vector Y from SE to NE -> `{1, -1}`

### When a NW (-1, -1) match is found at {x,y}, check y-2 for a SW match, and check x-2 for a NE match

- coord `{2, 2}` -> `2 + vector * (word_length-1)` -> `2 + -2` -> check `{2, 0}` & `{0, 2}`
- Check X to NE `{0, 2}` invert vector X from NW to NE -> `{1, -1}`
- Check Y to SW `{2, 0}` invert vector Y from NW to SW -> `{-1, 1}`
