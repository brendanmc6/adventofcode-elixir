# Day07_P01

Brute force combinations until a match is found or can not possibly be found

```elixir
# base case, end of list
def solvable?(acc, [n], op, target) do
  op.(acc, n) == target
end

# Recurse case: proceed if < target and not end of list

def solvable?(acc, [n | rest], op, target) do
  val = op.(acc, n)
  if val >= target do
   false
  else
   solvable?(val, rest, add) or solvable?(val, rest, mul)
  end
end
```
